A go library for controlling Philips Hue light(s) with bluetooth.

My motivation for this project started with not being able to control my light with my laptop, but also that [Philips is now forcing users to make an account in order to use their purchased light(s)](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/16oaozs/philips_hue_will_soon_force_users_to_create_a_hue/),
so now I've gotten a bigger reason to make this!

## Example
An example can be found at [example.go](./example.go)

## Contributing
Currently, contributing is a bit difficult right now, since a lot the code for controlling a light is shared logic. I haven't gotten around to separating it yet.
